# Laravel Handyman Application - Implementation Notes

> **Project**: Multi-User Handyman Management System  
> **Date**: June 2, 2025  
> **Status**: ✅ Production Ready

## 📋 Overview

This Laravel application implements a comprehensive handyman management system supporting three distinct user types with different permissions and access levels:

- **Solo Handymen**: Independent workers with full control over their own data
- **Company Admins**: Managers who oversee employees and company-wide operations
- **Company Employees**: Field workers with mobile-only access and limited permissions

## 🏗️ Architecture & Business Logic

### User Type Hierarchy

```php
// User Model Constants
const TYPE_SOLO_HANDYMAN = 'solo_handyman';
const TYPE_COMPANY_ADMIN = 'company_admin';
const TYPE_COMPANY_EMPLOYEE = 'company_employee';
```

### Data Scoping Strategy

#### Solo Handymen

- **Scope**: Own data only
- **Permissions**: Full CRUD on their discoveries
- **Access**: Web dashboard + API

#### Company Admins

- **Scope**: Company-wide data
- **Permissions**: Manage employees, work groups, company discoveries
- **Access**: Web dashboard + API

#### Company Employees

- **Scope**: Work group assignments + personal assignments
- **Permissions**: Edit assigned discoveries, self-assignment
- **Access**: Mobile API only (web dashboard blocked)

## 🔒 Authorization Implementation

### Middleware Protection

```php
// RestrictEmployeeDashboard.php
if ($user && $user->isCompanyEmployee()) {
    abort(403, 'Company employees cannot access the web dashboard. Please use the mobile application.');
}
```

### Policy-Based Authorization

**WorkGroupPolicy.php**

- Controls access to work group management
- Validates company ownership and user permissions

**CompanyPolicy.php**

- Manages company-level access control
- Ensures admins can only manage their own company

### Controller-Level Security

**Discovery Scoping Example:**

```php
public function index()
{
    $user = auth()->user();
    $query = Discovery::with(['creator', 'assignee', 'company', 'workGroup']);

    if ($user->isSoloHandyman()) {
        $query->where('creator_id', $user->id);
    } elseif ($user->isCompanyAdmin()) {
        $query->where('company_id', $user->company_id);
    } elseif ($user->isCompanyEmployee()) {
        $workGroupIds = $user->workGroups->pluck('id');
        $query->where(function ($q) use ($user, $workGroupIds) {
            $q->whereIn('work_group_id', $workGroupIds)
                ->orWhere('assignee_id', $user->id);
        });
    }

    return $query->latest()->paginate(12);
}
```

## 📱 Mobile API Features

### Authentication

- **Sanctum Token-Based**: Secure API authentication
- **Route Protection**: All API routes require `auth:sanctum` middleware

### Discovery Assignment

```php
// Self-assignment for mobile workers
POST /api/discoveries/{discovery}/assign
DELETE /api/discoveries/{discovery}/assign
```

### Company Management API

```php
// Company data access for mobile admins
GET /api/company
POST /api/company/employees
PATCH /api/company/employees/{employee}
DELETE /api/company/employees/{employee}
```

### Work Group API

```php
// Work group access for mobile users
GET /api/work-groups
POST /api/work-groups
GET /api/work-groups/{workGroup}
```

## 🎨 User Interface Implementation

### Navigation Context Awareness

```blade
@if(auth()->user()->isSoloHandyman() || auth()->user()->isCompanyAdmin())
    <a href="{{ route('work-groups.index') }}">Çalışma Grupları</a>
@endif

@if(auth()->user()->isCompanyAdmin())
    <a href="{{ route('company.index') }}">Şirket Yönetimi</a>
@endif
```

### Responsive Design Features

- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern, responsive styling
- **Modal-Based CRUD**: Clean user experience for data management
- **Dashboard Scoping**: Context-aware data display based on user type

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Access Control Lists

| Feature                | Solo Handyman  | Company Admin     | Company Employee         |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Web Dashboard**      | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Full Access    | ❌ Mobile Only           |
| **Create Discoveries** | ✅             | ✅                | ❌                       |
| **Edit Discoveries**   | ✅ Own Only    | ✅ Company-wide   | ✅ Assigned Only         |
| **View Discoveries**   | ✅ Own Only    | ✅ Company-wide   | ✅ Work Group + Assigned |
| **Manage Employees**   | ❌             | ✅                | ❌                       |
| **Manage Work Groups** | ✅ Own Groups  | ✅ Company Groups | ❌                       |
| **Self-Assignment**    | ❌             | ❌                | ✅                       |

### Route Protection Strategy

```php
// Web Routes - Employee Access Blocked
Route::middleware(['auth', 'restrict.employee.dashboard'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', /* Dashboard Controller */);
    Route::resource('discovery', DiscoveryController::class);
    Route::resource('work-groups', WorkGroupController::class);
    Route::resource('company', CompanyController::class);
});

// API Routes - Token Authentication
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
    Route::apiResource('discoveries', DiscoveryController::class);
    Route::apiResource('work-groups', WorkGroupController::class);
    Route::apiResource('company', CompanyController::class);
});
```

## 📊 Database Design

### Core Tables

- **users**: Main user table with `user_type` and `company_id`
- **companies**: Company information and settings
- **work_groups**: Team organization within companies
- **discoveries**: Main work items/projects
- **user_work_group**: Many-to-many relationship for employee assignments

### Key Relationships

```php
// User Model Relationships
public function company(): BelongsTo
public function managedCompany(): HasOne
public function workGroups(): BelongsToMany
public function createdDiscoveries(): HasMany
public function assignedDiscoveries(): HasMany

// Company Model Relationships
public function admin(): BelongsTo
public function employees(): HasMany
public function workGroups(): HasMany
public function discoveries(): HasMany
```

## 🚀 Deployment & Production Readiness

### Performance Optimizations

- **Eager Loading**: Relationships loaded efficiently with `with()`
- **Query Scoping**: Database-level filtering reduces memory usage
- **Route Caching**: Production-ready route optimization
- **Config Caching**: Optimized configuration loading

### Error Handling

```php
try {
    // Business logic
    return response()->json(['success' => true, 'data' => $result]);
} catch (\Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException $e) {
    return response()->json(['success' => false, 'errors' => $e->errors()], 422);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    \Log::error('Operation failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
    return response()->json(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Operation failed'], 500);
}
```
