# Discovery Address Modal Implementation - COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive address modal for the discovery show/edit page that allows viewing and editing of all address types (manual or registered property address).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Address Display Logic

- Shows either manual address or registered property address
- Displays formatted address information
- Includes Google Maps link button for navigation
- Shows coordinates when available

### 2. Address Change Modal

- **Modal Trigger**: "Düzenle" (Edit) button that opens address modal when in edit mode
- **Address Type Selection**: Radio buttons for "Property" vs "Manual" address
- **Property Selection**: Dropdown with company properties (loaded via API)
- **Manual Address Input**:
  - City dropdown (populated from AddressData)
  - District dropdown (dynamically populated based on city selection)
  - Address details textarea for additional information
  - Interactive map picker using Leaflet for location selection

### 3. Map Integration

- **Leaflet Map**: Interactive map for location picking
- **Click to Select**: Users can click on map to set coordinates
- **Current Location**: Button to get user's current GPS location
- **Coordinate Display**: Shows selected latitude/longitude
- **Map Centering**: Automatically centers on selected location

### 4. Data Handling

- **Address Combination**: Combines city, district, and details into a single address string
- **Coordinate Saving**: Saves latitude/longitude for both property and manual addresses
- **Form Integration**: Hidden inputs for seamless form submission
- **Validation**: Ensures either property or manual address is provided

### 5. Alpine.js Components

- **addressDisplay()**: Manages address display and modal state
- **addressModalData()**: Handles modal logic and property selection
- **manualAddressSelector()**: Manages manual address input, map, and location services
