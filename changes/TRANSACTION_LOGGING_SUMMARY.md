# Transaction Logging System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive transaction logging system for the Handi Laravel application that tracks all user actions and discovery events.

## Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema

- **Created `transaction_logs` table** with comprehensive fields:
  - `user_id` - Who performed the action (nullable for customer actions)
  - `discovery_id` - Which discovery was affected
  - `action` - Type of action performed (created, updated, status_changed, approved, rejected, etc.)
  - `old_values` & `new_values` - JSON fields tracking what changed
  - `performed_by_type` - Whether action was by user, customer, or system
  - `performed_by_identifier` - Email or other identifier for non-user actions
  - `metadata` - Additional context information
  - `ip_address` & `user_agent` - Request tracking
  - Proper indexes for performance

### 2. Model & Service Layer

- **TransactionLog Model** with:

  - Action constants (CREATED, UPDATED, STATUS_CHANGED, APPROVED, REJECTED, etc.)
  - Performer type constants (USER, CUSTOMER, SYSTEM)
  - Relationships to User and Discovery models
  - JSON casting for values and metadata fields

- **TransactionLogService** with static methods for logging:
  - `logDiscoveryCreated()` - New discovery creation
  - `logStatusChange()` - Status transitions
  - `logCustomerApproval()` - Customer approvals via shared link
  - `logCustomerRejection()` - Customer rejections via shared link
  - `logAssignment()` - Discovery assignments
  - `logUnassignment()` - Discovery unassignments
  - `logDiscoveryUpdate()` - General discovery updates
  - `logDiscoveryDeleted()` - Discovery deletions
  - `logDiscoveryViewed()` - Views via shared link
  - `logDiscoveryShared()` - Share URL generation

### 3. Controller Integration

**Updated DiscoveryController** with transaction logging in all methods:

- `store()` - Logs discovery creation
- `update()` - Logs discovery updates with change tracking
- `destroy()` - Logs discovery deletion
- `updateStatus()` - Logs status changes
- `assignToSelf()` - Logs self-assignments
- `unassignFromSelf()` - Logs self-unassignments
- `apiStore()` - Logs API discovery creation
- `apiUpdate()` - Logs API discovery updates
- `apiUpdateStatus()` - Logs API status changes
- `customerApprove()` - Logs customer approval actions
- `customerReject()` - Logs customer rejection actions
- `apiGetShareUrl()` - Logs share URL generation

### 4. Customer Approval/Rejection System

- **Added customer approval/rejection routes**:

  - `POST /shared/discovery/{token}/approve`
  - `POST /shared/discovery/{token}/reject`

- **Enhanced shared discovery view** (`shared.blade.php`):
  - Status display with color-coded badges
  - Action buttons for pending discoveries
  - Confirmation dialogs
  - Success/error messaging
  - Automatic logging of customer actions

### 5. Admin Interface

- **Transaction Logs View** (`/transaction-logs`):

  - Paginated list of all transaction logs
  - Filtering by user company/scope
  - Color-coded action badges
  - Detailed action information
  - User and discovery information
  - Navigation integration

- **Added navigation link** for "İşlem Geçmişi" (Transaction History)

### 6. Testing Infrastructure

Created testing commands:

- `php artisan test:transaction-logging` - Tests all logging functions
- `php artisan create:test-discovery` - Creates test discoveries
- `php artisan list:discoveries` - Lists all discoveries
- `php artisan get:share-url` - Gets share URLs for testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE transaction_logs (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
    entity_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'discovery',
    entity_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    discovery_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    old_values JSON NULL,
    new_values JSON NULL,
    performed_by_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',
    performed_by_identifier VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    metadata JSON NULL,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45) NULL,
    user_agent TEXT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    INDEX(discovery_id),
    INDEX(user_id),
    INDEX(action),
    INDEX(created_at)
);
```

### Logged Actions

- **created** - Discovery creation
- **updated** - Discovery updates
- **status_changed** - Status transitions
- **approved** - Customer approval
- **rejected** - Customer rejection
- **assigned** - Discovery assignment
- **unassigned** - Discovery unassignment
- **deleted** - Discovery deletion
- **viewed** - Shared link views
- **shared** - Share URL generation

### Security & Privacy

- Customer actions don't require authentication
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Proper scoping for company/user visibility
- No sensitive data logged in plain text

## Testing Results

✅ All transaction logging functions tested and working
✅ Customer approval/rejection workflow functional
✅ Admin transaction logs view operational
✅ Database migrations completed successfully
✅ Navigation integration complete

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Discovery (automatically logged)

```php
$discovery = Discovery::create($data);
// TransactionLogService::logDiscoveryCreated() called automatically
```

### Customer Approval via Shared Link

```php
// URL: /shared/discovery/{token}/approve
// Automatically logs customer approval and status change
```

### Viewing Transaction Logs

- Navigate to `/transaction-logs` (admin only)
- View all company/user-scoped activities
- Filter and paginate through logs
