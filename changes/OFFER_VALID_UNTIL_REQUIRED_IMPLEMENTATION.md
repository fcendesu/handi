# Offer Valid Until Field - Compulsory Implementation

## Overview

The "offer valid until" field in the discovery creation and editing forms has been made compulsory to ensure all discoveries have a clear expiration date for their offers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Validation

Updated validation rules in `app/Http/Controllers/DiscoveryController.php`:

**Store Method (Line ~91):**

```php
'offer_valid_until' => 'required|date',
```

**Update Method (Line ~259):**

```php
'offer_valid_until' => 'required|date',
```

### 2. Frontend Form Updates

**Creation Form (`resources/views/discovery/index.blade.php`):**

- Added asterisk (\*) to field label to indicate required field
- Added `required` attribute to the input field
- Label updated to: "Teklif Geçerlilik Tarihi \*"

**Edit Form (`resources/views/discovery/show.blade.php`):**

- Added asterisk (\*) to field label to indicate required field
- Added `required` attribute to the input field
- Label updated to: "Teklif Geçerlilik Tarihi \*"

## Validation Behavior

### Creating Discoveries

- Solo handymen and company admins must provide an offer valid until date
- Form submission will fail with validation error if field is empty
- Error message: "The offer valid until field is required."

### Updating Discoveries

- Existing discoveries being updated must have an offer valid until date
- Updates will fail with validation error if field is cleared or not provided

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/Feature/DiscoveryOfferValidUntilRequiredTest.php`:

### Test Coverage

1. **Solo Handyman Creation Validation** - Ensures solo handymen cannot create discoveries without offer valid until
2. **Company Admin Creation Validation** - Ensures company admins cannot create discoveries without offer valid until
3. **Error Message Validation** - Confirms proper error messages are shown

### Test Results

```
✓ offer valid until is required when creating discovery as solo handyman
✓ offer valid until is required when creating discovery as company admin
✓ validation error message contains offer valid until
```

All existing tests continue to pass (46 total tests, 140 assertions).

## User Experience

- Field is clearly marked as required with asterisk (\*)
- Browser-level validation prevents form submission if field is empty
- Server-side validation provides fallback with clear error messages
- Consistent behavior across creation and editing workflows

## Technical Notes

- Validation is enforced at both frontend (HTML required attribute) and backend (Laravel validation)
- No breaking changes to existing data - only affects new discoveries and updates
- Compatible with all user types (solo handyman, company admin, company employee for updates)

## Files Modified

1. `app/Http/Controllers/DiscoveryController.php` - Updated validation rules
2. `resources/views/discovery/index.blade.php` - Updated creation form
3. `resources/views/discovery/show.blade.php` - Updated edit form
4. `tests/Feature/DiscoveryOfferValidUntilRequiredTest.php` - New test suite

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - The "offer valid until" field is now compulsory for all discovery creation and editing operations.
