# Address Save Button Implementation - COMPLETED

## Problem

The "Kaydet" (Save) button in the address modal was not actually saving address changes to the database. Users could change between registered properties or modify manual address details, but clicking save only updated the frontend display without persisting the changes to the Discovery model.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/DiscoveryController.php`

- Added `updateAddress()` method to handle AJAX address updates
- Validates address data (property vs manual)
- Checks user permissions to update the discovery
- Updates the Discovery model with new address information
- Returns JSON response with updated data

**Route:** `PATCH /discovery/{discovery}/address`

- Added to `routes/web.php` as `discovery.update-address`

### 2. Frontend AJAX Implementation

**File:** `resources/views/discovery/show.blade.php`

#### Modified `saveAddress()` function:

- Changed from simple event dispatch to async AJAX call
- Prepares form data based on address type (property/manual)
- Makes PATCH request to new endpoint
- Shows loading state on save button ("Kaydediliyor...")
- Handles success/error responses with notifications
- Dispatches event to update display after successful save

#### Enhanced `handleAddressSaved()` function:

- Now uses server response data for display updates
- Properly handles both property and manual address data
- Ensures UI reflects the actual saved data from database

### 3. User Experience Improvements

- **Loading State:** Save button shows "Kaydediliyor..." while saving
- **Success Notifications:** Green notification when address is saved successfully
- **Error Handling:** Red notification for validation errors or server issues
- **Immediate Feedback:** Modal closes and display updates immediately after save
- **Form Integration:** Hidden form fields are automatically updated via Alpine.js `x-model`

### 4. Data Validation

Backend validates:

- Address type (property/manual)
- Property access permissions
- Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- User permissions to update the discovery

### 5. Database Updates

When saving:

- **Property Address:** Sets `property_id`, clears manual fields, copies property coordinates
- **Manual Address:** Clears `property_id`, saves manual address fields and coordinates

## Usage

1. User opens discovery page in edit mode
2. Clicks "Adresi Değiştir" (Change Address)
3. Selects different property OR modifies manual address
4. Clicks "Kaydet" (Save)
5. System saves to database and shows success notification
6. Modal closes and address display updates immediately
7. Changes are persisted - will show correctly on page refresh

## Technical Notes

- Uses Alpine.js for frontend reactivity
- CSRF protection implemented
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Server-side validation for security
- Maintains existing form functionality for full discovery updates

## Files Modified

1. `app/Http/Controllers/DiscoveryController.php` - Added updateAddress method
2. `routes/web.php` - Added address update route
3. `resources/views/discovery/show.blade.php` - Enhanced saveAddress and handleAddressSaved functions

## Testing

- Test changing between different registered properties
- Test updating manual address details
- Test latitude/longitude updates
- Test error scenarios (network issues, validation errors)
- Test permissions (different user roles)
- Test form submission still works after address changes
