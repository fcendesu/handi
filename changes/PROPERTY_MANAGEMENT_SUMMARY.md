# Property Management System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Structure

**Properties Table** (`2025_06_02_183304_create_properties_table.php`):

- `id` - Primary key
- `company_id` - Foreign key to companies table
- `name` - Property name/identifier
- `city` - City (Lefko≈üa, Girne, Maƒüusa, ƒ∞skele, G√ºzelyurt, Lefke)
- `neighborhood` - Neighborhood within city
- `site_name` - Optional site/complex name
- `building_name` - Optional building name
- `street` - Required street address
- `door_apartment_no` - Required door/apartment number
- `latitude` - Optional GPS coordinate
- `longitude` - Optional GPS coordinate
- `notes` - Optional additional notes
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

**Discoveries Table Update** (`2025_06_02_183516_add_property_id_to_discoveries_table.php`):

- Added `property_id` foreign key to link discoveries to saved properties

### 2. Models & Relationships

**Property Model** (`app/Models/Property.php`):

- Belongs to Company
- Has many Discoveries
- Fillable fields for all property attributes
- Automatic company_id assignment via model events

**Company Model** - Updated:

- Has many Properties relationship

**Discovery Model** - Updated:

- Belongs to Property (optional relationship)
- Added property_id to fillable array

### 3. Authorization & Security

**PropertyPolicy** (`app/Policies/PropertyPolicy.php`):

- Only company admins can manage properties
- Solo handymen cannot access property management
- Company employees cannot manage properties
- All operations scoped to user's company

**Registered in AuthServiceProvider**:

- PropertyPolicy properly registered for authorization

### 4. Backend Controller

**PropertyController** (`app/Http/Controllers/PropertyController.php`):

- Full CRUD operations (index, create, store, show, edit, update, destroy)
- Company-scoped property access
- Authorization checks on all methods
- API endpoint for dynamic property loading (`getCompanyProperties`)
- Proper validation and error handling

### 5. Frontend Views

**Property Index** (`resources/views/property/index.blade.php`):

- Lists all company properties
- Pagination support
- Action buttons (View, Edit, Delete)
- "Add New Property" button
- Responsive design

**Property Create** (`resources/views/property/create.blade.php`):

- Hierarchical address form (City ‚Üí Neighborhood ‚Üí Site ‚Üí Building ‚Üí Street ‚Üí Door)
- Dropdown selectors for cities and neighborhoods
- Optional geolocation fields
- Form validation with error display
- Geolocation button for automatic coordinate detection

**Property Edit** (`resources/views/property/edit.blade.php`):

- Pre-populated form with existing property data
- Same hierarchical address structure
- Update functionality with validation

**Property Show** (`resources/views/property/show.blade.php`):

- Detailed property information display
- Google Maps links for coordinates
- Related discoveries listing
- Edit and delete action buttons

### 6. Discovery Integration

**Updated Discovery Creation** (`resources/views/discovery/index.blade.php`):

- Radio button selection: "Saved Property" vs "Manual Address"
- Dynamic property selector with Alpine.js
- Property selection loads full address automatically
- Maintains backward compatibility with manual address entry

**DiscoveryController Updates**:

- Validation for both property selection and manual address
- Property ownership verification (must belong to user's company)
- Automatic property_id assignment when property is selected

### 7. Routing

**Web Routes** (`routes/web.php`):

- Resource routes for properties (properties.\*)
- API endpoint for company properties
- Proper middleware and authorization

### 8. Navigation

**Updated Navigation** (`resources/views/components/navigation.blade.php`):

- Added "M√ºlkler" (Properties) link for company admins
- Proper route highlighting
- Access control (only company admins see the link)

### 9. Testing

**PropertyManagementTest** (`tests/Feature/PropertyManagementTest.php`):

- Tests for property access authorization
- Tests for property creation
- Tests for company-scoped access
- Factories for Company and Property models

- K√º√ß√ºk Kaymaklƒ±
- Hamitk√∂y
- Ortak√∂y
- And more...

### Geolocation Support

- Optional latitude/longitude coordinates
- Google Maps integration for viewing locations
- Geolocation API support for automatic coordinate detection

## üîê Security Features

### Access Control

- **Company Admins**: Full property management access
- **Solo Handymen**: No access to property management

### Data Validation

- Required fields enforced
- City/neighborhood validation against predefined lists
- Coordinate validation for proper GPS format

## üöÄ Usage Workflow

### For Company Admins:

1. Navigate to "M√ºlkler" in the main menu
2. View list of saved properties
3. Add new properties with hierarchical address structure
4. Edit existing properties as needed
5. When creating discoveries, select from saved properties or use manual address

### For Discovery Creation:

1. Choose "Saved Property" to select from company's saved addresses
2. Choose "Manual Address" to enter address manually
3. If using saved property, address fields auto-populate
4. Property ownership is automatically verified

## üìä Database Relationships

```
Company (1) ‚Üí (many) Properties
Property (1) ‚Üí (many) Discoveries
User (1) ‚Üí (many) Discoveries (creator)
Company (1) ‚Üí (many) Users
```

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

- Dynamic neighborhood loading based on selected city
- Google Maps embedded view in property details
- Bulk property import functionality
- Property templates for common address patterns
- Property usage statistics and reporting
- Integration with external mapping services
- Property image attachments
- Advanced search and filtering options

## ‚úÖ Testing Coverage

- Property CRUD operations
- Authorization and access control
- Company-scoped property access
- Property-discovery relationship
- Form validation and error handling

The property management system is now fully functional and integrated with the existing discovery workflow, providing a comprehensive solution for managing frequently visited addresses in a hierarchical, organized manner.
