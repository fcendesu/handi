# Discovery Assignee Feature Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the discovery assignee feature that allows company admins to assign company employees to discoveries. This feature is only visible and accessible to company users (admins and employees), not solo handymen.

## Key Features

1. **Company Admin Assignment**: Only company admins can assign discoveries to company employees
2. **Employee Visibility**: Both company admins and employees can see the assignee field
3. **API Support**: Full API support for mobile applications
4. **Validation**: Proper validation ensures only employees from the same company can be assigned

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Structure

- `assignee_id` field already exists in discoveries table with foreign key constraint
- Relationship properly defined in Discovery model

#### 2. Controller Updates

- **DiscoveryController**: Added `assignee_id` validation in store, update, apiStore, and apiUpdate methods
- **CompanyController**: Added `getAssignableEmployees()` API method
- Validation ensures:
  - Only company admins can assign discoveries
  - Assignee must be a company employee from the same company
  - Assignee can be null (unassigned)

#### 3. Model Enhancements

- **Company Model**: Added `assignableEmployees()` relationship method
- **Discovery Model**: Existing `assignee()` relationship works correctly
- **User Model**: Existing `assignedDiscoveries()` relationship works correctly

#### 4. API Endpoints

- `GET /api/company/assignable-employees` - Get list of assignable employees (company admin only)
- Updated discovery API endpoints to handle `assignee_id` field
- API responses include full assignee details for mobile

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Discovery Creation Form (index.blade.php)

- Added assignee dropdown for company admins
- Only shows when user is company admin and company has employees
- Dropdown includes employee name and email

#### 2. Discovery Details/Edit Form (show.blade.php)

- Added assignee display section for all company users
- View mode shows assigned employee (or "no assignment")
- Edit mode allows company admins to change assignment
- Company employees can see but not edit assignee

#### 3. Route Updates

- Added web route: `GET /api/company/assignable-employees`
- Added API route: `GET /api/company/assignable-employees`

### Access Control

- **Solo Handymen**: Cannot see or use assignee feature
- **Company Admins**: Can view, assign, reassign, and unassign discoveries
- **Company Employees**: Can view assignee but cannot assign/change assignments

### Validation Rules

1. `assignee_id` must exist in users table
2. Assignee must be a company employee (`user_type = 'company_employee'`)
3. Assignee must belong to the same company as the admin making the assignment
4. Only company admins can modify assignee field

### API Response Format

```json
{
  "assignee": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Employee Name",
    "email": "employee@company.com",
    "user_type": "company_employee"
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

- ✅ Company model `assignableEmployees()` relationship works
- ✅ API endpoint `getAssignableEmployees()` returns correct data
- ✅ Discovery creation with assignee works
- ✅ API responses include assignee details
- ✅ Validation prevents cross-company assignments
- ✅ Only company admins can assign discoveries

## Files Modified

1. `app/Http/Controllers/DiscoveryController.php` - Added assignee validation
2. `app/Http/Controllers/CompanyController.php` - Added assignable employees API
3. `app/Models/Company.php` - Added assignableEmployees relationship
4. `resources/views/discovery/index.blade.php` - Added assignee dropdown
5. `resources/views/discovery/show.blade.php` - Added assignee display/edit
6. `routes/web.php` - Added assignable employees route
7. `routes/api.php` - Added assignable employees API route

## Next Steps for Mobile Implementation

1. Update mobile app to fetch assignable employees from `/api/company/assignable-employees`
2. Add assignee selection in mobile discovery creation/edit forms
3. Display assignee information in mobile discovery details
4. Ensure mobile respects the same access control rules (only company admins can assign)

The feature is now fully implemented and ready for use in both web and mobile applications.
