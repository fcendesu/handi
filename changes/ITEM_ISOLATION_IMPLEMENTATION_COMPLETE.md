- No user can access items they don't own
- No company can access items from other companies
- All search and discovery functions are properly scoped

## Test Results Summary

## Final Status
ðŸŽ‰ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**

The item isolation system is now fully functional and secure. All users can only access their own items, and all critical code paths have been tested and verified. The application is ready for production use with complete item data isolation.
