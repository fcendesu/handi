# District Dropdown Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Resolved ✅

The district dropdown in the address modal on the discovery show/edit page was not visually selecting the correct district value, even though the data was correctly populated.

## Root Cause

Alpine.js x-for template reactivity issue where the select dropdown wasn't properly synchronizing the selected value with the option elements.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced x-for Template Key

```html
<template
  x-for="district in districts"
  :key="`${selectedCity}-${district}`"
></template>
```

- Changed from simple `:key="district"` to composite key
- Forces re-rendering when city changes

### 2. Added Explicit Selected Attribute

```html
<option
  :value="district"
  x-text="district"
  :selected="district === selectedDistrict"
></option>
```

- Explicitly sets the selected attribute for proper visual feedback

### 3. Enhanced updateDistricts() Function

```javascript
updateDistricts() {
    const cityDistrictMap = @json(\App\Data\AddressData::getAllDistricts());
    const currentDistrict = this.selectedDistrict;

    this.districts = cityDistrictMap[this.selectedCity] || [];

    if (currentDistrict && this.districts.length > 0) {
        const isDistrictValid = this.districts.includes(currentDistrict);

        if (isDistrictValid) {
            // Force re-assignment to trigger reactivity
            this.selectedDistrict = '';
            this.$nextTick(() => {
                this.selectedDistrict = currentDistrict;
            });
        } else {
            this.selectedDistrict = '';
        }
    }
}
```

- Implements reactivity reset pattern
- Uses `$nextTick()` for proper DOM update timing
- Validates district against available options

### 4. Improved Modal Watcher

```javascript
x-init="$watch('$parent.showAddressModal', value => {
    if (value) {
        updateDistricts();
        setTimeout(() => updateDistricts(), 50);
    }
})"
```

- Triggers immediate and delayed district updates when modal opens
- Ensures proper initialization timing

## Current Functionality ✅

- ✅ Populates district dropdown when modal opens
