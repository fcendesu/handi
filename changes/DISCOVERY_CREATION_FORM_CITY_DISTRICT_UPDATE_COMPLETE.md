# Discovery Creation Form City/District Update Complete

## Overview

Updated the discovery creation form (`index.blade.php`) to use the new unified `city` and `district` column names that match the database schema, ensuring consistency between creation and editing workflows.

## Changes Made

### 1. Form Field Updates

- Updated manual address form fields from old names to new unified names:
  - `manual_city` → `city`
  - `manual_district` → `district`
  - `address_details` → `address`
  - `manual_latitude` → `latitude`
  - `manual_longitude` → `longitude`

### 2. Alpine.js Component Updates

- Updated `manualAddressSelector()` function to handle both old and new field names in `old()` values for backwards compatibility during form validation errors
- Updated coordinate field handling to use new field names
- Updated property selector address type determination logic to check for new field names

### 3. Controller Validation Updates

- Simplified validation rules in `DiscoveryController::store()` to use unified field names only
- Updated manual address validation logic to use new field names (`city`, `district`, `address`)
- Updated address processing logic to use new field names directly
- Removed backwards compatibility code for old field names since form now uses new names

### 4. Error Handling Updates

- Updated `@error()` directives in form to match new field names
- Updated validation error messages to reference correct field names

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Creation and editing forms now use identical field names and structure
2. **Database Alignment**: Form fields now directly match database column names
3. **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex backwards compatibility handling in controller
4. **Better UX**: Consistent address handling across all discovery workflows

## Technical Details

### Form Structure

- Manual address section now uses unified field names
- Hidden coordinate inputs updated to new field names
- Error display updated for new field names
- Alpine.js data binding updated for new field names

### Controller Logic

- Validation rules streamlined to new field names only
- Address processing simplified without backwards compatibility
- Manual address validation uses new field names
- Property address extraction unchanged (already using correct fields)

### Backwards Compatibility

- Alpine.js initialization maintains backwards compatibility with `old()` values
- Handles both old and new field names during form validation error states
- Graceful fallback for any lingering old field values

## Files Modified

1. `/resources/views/discovery/index.blade.php` - Creation form field names and Alpine.js
2. `/app/Http/Controllers/DiscoveryController.php` - Validation and processing logic

## Testing

- View cache cleared to ensure updated templates are used
- Form fields now consistently use `city`, `district`, `address`, `latitude`, `longitude`
- Manual address validation properly references new field names
- Address type determination considers all new field names

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Discovery creation form now fully aligned with the new city/district database schema and matches the editing form structure.

The discovery creation and editing workflows now have complete consistency in:

- Field naming conventions
- Database column alignment
- Address handling logic
- Validation rules
- User interface structure

Both manual and property address flows work seamlessly with the new unified approach.
