# Property Owner Information Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Successfully added separate owner information columns to the Property model, allowing properties to have their own owner details (name, email, phone) independent of the User/Company that manages the property.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration

**File:** `database/migrations/2025_06_19_184656_add_owner_details_to_properties_table.php`

- Added `owner_name` (nullable string)
- Added `owner_email` (nullable string)
- Added `owner_phone` (nullable string)
- All fields placed after the `name` column

### 2. Property Model Updates

**File:** `app/Models/Property.php`

- Added new fields to `$fillable` array:
  - `owner_name`
  - `owner_email`
  - `owner_phone`

### 3. PropertyController Updates

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PropertyController.php`

#### Store Method

- Added validation for new owner fields:
  - `owner_name`: nullable|string|max:255
  - `owner_email`: nullable|email|max:255
  - `owner_phone`: nullable|string|max:20

#### Update Method

- Added same validation rules for owner fields
- Both methods now handle the new owner information during property creation/editing

### 4. Property Index View Updates

**File:** `resources/views/property/index.blade.php`

#### Table Headers

- Replaced single "Sahibi" column with separate columns:
  - "Sahip Adı" (Owner Name)
  - "E-posta" (Email)
  - "Telefon" (Phone)

#### Table Body

- Updated to display new owner information:
  - Shows owner name or "Belirtilmemiş" if not set
  - Shows owner email or "-" if not set
  - Shows owner phone or "-" if not set
- Maintained responsive table layout

### 5. Property Create Form Updates

**File:** `resources/views/property/create.blade.php`

- Added "Mülk Sahibi Bilgileri" section after Property Name
- Included form fields for:
  - Owner Name (full width)
  - Owner Email (half width, left column)
  - Owner Phone (half width, right column)
- Added proper validation error handling
- Included helpful placeholder text

### 6. Property Edit Form Updates

**File:** `resources/views/property/edit.blade.php`

- Added same "Mülk Sahibi Bilgileri" section
- Pre-populates fields with existing property values
- Same layout and validation as create form

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

```sql
ALTER TABLE properties ADD COLUMN owner_name VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER name;
ALTER TABLE properties ADD COLUMN owner_email VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER owner_name;
ALTER TABLE properties ADD COLUMN owner_phone VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER owner_email;
```

### Form Validation Rules

```php
'owner_name' => 'nullable|string|max:255',
'owner_email' => 'nullable|email|max:255',
'owner_phone' => 'nullable|string|max:20',
```

### Display Logic

```blade
{{ $property->owner_name ?? 'Belirtilmemiş' }}
{{ $property->owner_email ?? '-' }}
{{ $property->owner_phone ?? '-' }}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Property ownership info is now separate from system user/company relationships
2. **Flexibility**: Properties can belong to external owners not in the system
3. **Complete Contact Info**: Name, email, and phone all captured for property owners
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear form sections and helpful placeholders
5. **Responsive Design**: Table adapts to different screen sizes
6. **Data Integrity**: Proper validation and error handling
