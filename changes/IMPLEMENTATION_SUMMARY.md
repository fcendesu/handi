# Multiple Company Admins - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Backend Controller Methods

Added to `CompanyController.php`:

- `promoteToAdmin(User $employee)` - Promote employee to admin
- `demoteFromAdmin(User $admin)` - Demote admin to employee
- `createAdmin(Request $request)` - Create new admin directly
- `transferPrimaryAdmin(Request $request)` - Transfer primary admin role

### 2. Routes Added

```php
// In web.php
Route::post('/company/admins', [CompanyController::class, 'createAdmin'])->name('company.create-admin');
Route::patch('/company/employees/{employee}/promote', [CompanyController::class, 'promoteToAdmin'])->name('company.promote-admin');
Route::patch('/company/admins/{admin}/demote', [CompanyController::class, 'demoteFromAdmin'])->name('company.demote-admin');
Route::patch('/company/transfer-primary-admin', [CompanyController::class, 'transferPrimaryAdmin'])->name('company.transfer-primary-admin');
```

### 3. UI Components Added

Updated `company/index.blade.php` with:

- **Company Admins Management Section** - Shows all admins with badges
- **Promote Button** - On employee rows (for primary admin only)
- **Admin Actions** - Transfer primary role, demote admin
- **Modal Dialogs**:
  - Create Admin Modal
  - Promote Employee Modal
  - Demote Admin Modal
  - Transfer Primary Admin Modal

### 4. Security & Permissions

- **Primary Admin Only**: Can create, promote, demote, and transfer admin roles
- **Secondary Admins**: Can manage employees and work groups, but not other admins
- **Self-Protection**: Users cannot demote themselves
- **Company Scoping**: All operations scoped to user's company

### 5. Database Structure

No migrations needed - leverages existing:

- `companies.admin_id` - Points to primary admin
- `users.user_type` - Distinguishes admin vs employee
- `Company.allAdmins()` relationship - Gets all company admins
