# Discovery API Property Switching Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented property switching functionality in the Discovery API to support mobile app requirements for switching between registered properties and manual addresses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Validation Rules

- Added `property_id` validation to the `apiUpdate` method in `DiscoveryController`
- Added `work_group_id` validation for relationship updates
- All validation rules now include proper existence checks

### 2. Added Missing Imports

- Added `PaymentMethod` and `WorkGroup` model imports to `DiscoveryController`
- Fixed namespace references for relationship validation

### 3. Property Switching Logic

- **When switching TO registered property (`property_id` is set):**
  - Automatically clears all manual address fields: `address`, `city`, `district`, `neighborhood`, `latitude`, `longitude`
  - This prevents data inconsistency between property and manual address
- **When switching TO manual address (`property_id` is null):**
  - Clears the `property_id` field
  - Allows manual address fields to be set independently

### 4. Enhanced Relationship Validation

- Added company-scoped validation for company employees
- Validates that `payment_method_id`, `priority_id`, and `work_group_id` belong to the same company
- Returns appropriate 404 errors for cross-company access attempts

### 5. Fixed User Type Reference

- Changed `$user->role` to `$user->user_type` to match the database schema

## API Capabilities

The Discovery `apiUpdate` endpoint now supports:

### Core Fields

- ✅ Customer information (`customer_name`, `customer_phone`, `customer_email`)
- ✅ Discovery content (`discovery`, `todo_list`, `note_to_customer`, `note_to_handi`)
- ✅ Timing and costs (all cost fields, completion time, offer validity)
- ✅ Status updates
- ✅ Items management
- ✅ Image management

### Address Management

- ✅ **Property switching** (`property_id`)
- ✅ **Manual address** (`address`, `city`, `district`, `neighborhood`)
- ✅ **Coordinates** (`latitude`, `longitude`)
- ✅ **Automatic field clearing** when switching address types

### Relationships

- ✅ Work Groups (`work_group_id`)
- ✅ Priorities (`priority_id`)
- ✅ Payment Methods (`payment_method_id`)
- ✅ **Company-scoped validation** for all relationships

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Property Switching ✅

- Successfully switches from manual address to registered property
- Automatically clears manual address fields when property is set
- Successfully switches back to manual address
- Clears property_id when manual address is used

### Test 2: Relationship Updates ✅

- Work group updates work correctly
- Priority updates work correctly
- Payment method updates work correctly
- Combined relationship updates work correctly

### Test 3: Comprehensive Update ✅

- All fields can be updated simultaneously
- Property switching works in combination with other field updates
- Cost calculations work correctly
- Status updates work correctly

## Mobile App Integration

The mobile app can now:

1. **Fetch full discovery details** via `GET /api/discoveries/{id}`
2. **Update all discovery fields** via `PUT /api/discoveries/{id}` including:

   - Customer information
   - Discovery content and notes
   - Costs and timing
   - Work groups, priorities, payment methods
   - **Property and address switching**
   - Status updates
   - Items and images

3. **Switch address types seamlessly:**
   - Send `property_id: 1` to use registered property
   - Send `property_id: null` with manual address fields to use manual address
   - API automatically handles field clearing to prevent inconsistencies

## Security and Access Control

- ✅ Authorization checks for discovery ownership/access
- ✅ Company-scoped validation for relationships (employees can only use company resources)
- ✅ Proper validation for all input fields
- ✅ Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All requirements have been successfully implemented and tested. The mobile app now has full capability to manage discoveries including property/address switching functionality.
