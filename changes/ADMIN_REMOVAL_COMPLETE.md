## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### **Route Used**

```php
Route::patch('/company/admins/{admin}/demote', [CompanyController::class, 'demoteFromAdmin'])
    ->name('company.demote-admin');
```

### **Controller Method**

```php
public function demoteFromAdmin(User $admin)
{
    // Only primary admin can demote other admins
    // Cannot demote yourself
    // Company scoping verification
    // Updates user_type from company_admin to company_employee
}
```

### **Database Structure**

- Uses existing `allAdmins()` relationship in Company model
- Leverages `user_type` field for role management
- Maintains `company.admin_id` for primary admin reference

   - See all company admins with badges

3. **Remove Admin Privileges**:
   - Click "KaldÄ±r" button next to any secondary admin
   - Confirm in the modal popup
   - Admin is converted to regular employee

### **Security Features:**
