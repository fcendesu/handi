# District Dropdown Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue
The district dropdown in the address modal was not populating when a city was selected.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by nested Alpine.js components. The `manualAddressSelector()` function was being nested inside the `addressModalData()` component using `x-data="manualAddressSelector()"`, which created scoping issues for the district update functionality.

## Solution
**Consolidated Components**: Moved all manual address functionality (city/district selection, address details, map picker, etc.) directly into the main `addressModalData()` component, eliminating the nested component structure.

### Changes Made:

1. **Merged Functions**: 
   - Moved all properties and methods from `manualAddressSelector()` into `addressModalData()`
   - Added manual address fields: `selectedCity`, `selectedDistrict`, `addressDetails`, `districts`
   - Added map-related properties: `latitude`, `longitude`, `map`, `marker`, etc.

2. **Removed Nested Component**:
   - Removed `x-data="manualAddressSelector()"` from the HTML
   - Deleted the duplicate `manualAddressSelector()` function
   - Fixed Alpine.js scoping issues

3. **Updated Address Saving Logic**:
   - Modified `saveAddress()` to directly access properties instead of trying to access nested component data
   - Simplified address combination logic

4. **Enhanced Initialization**:
   - Added `parseExistingAddress()` to properly load existing address data
   - Improved `updateDistricts()` to handle city changes properly
   - Integrated map initialization with modal lifecycle

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic):
```html
<div x-data="addressModalData()">
  <div x-data="manualAddressSelector()"> <!-- Nested component caused scoping issues -->
    <select x-model="selectedCity" @change="updateDistricts()">
```

### After (Fixed):
```html
<div x-data="addressModalData()"> <!-- All functionality in one component -->
  <select x-model="selectedCity" @change="updateDistricts()">
```

### Key Functions Now Working:
- **City Selection**: Populates from AddressData::getCities()
- **District Population**: Dynamically updates based on selected city
- **Address Parsing**: Correctly parses existing addresses into components
- **Map Integration**: Leaflet map with click-to-select functionality
- **Form Integration**: Proper data saving and form submission

## Result
The district dropdown now properly populates when a city is selected, and all address modal functionality works seamlessly. Users can:

1. Select a city from the dropdown
2. See districts populate automatically 
3. Select a district from the populated list
4. Enter additional address details
5. Use the map picker to set coordinates
6. Save all address information properly

The implementation is now clean, efficient, and follows Alpine.js best practices by avoiding unnecessary component nesting.
