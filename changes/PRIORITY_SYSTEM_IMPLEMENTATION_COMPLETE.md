## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Priority management system for the Handi Laravel application, allowing solo handymen and company admins to create and manage custom priority badges for their discoveries.

### 4. **Discovery Integration**

- âœ… **Updated Discovery Model** (`app/Models/Discovery.php`)

  - Added `priority_id` to fillable fields
  - Added `priorityBadge()` relationship method
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing priority field

- âœ… **Updated Discovery Forms** (`resources/views/discovery/index.blade.php`)

  - Replaced static priority dropdown with dynamic priority selection

  - User-scoped priority options

- âœ… **Updated Discovery Details** (`resources/views/discovery/show.blade.php`)

2. **Var** (Has Priority) - Yellow (#F59E0B), Level 2 - "Ã–ncelik var"
3. **Acil** (Urgent) - Red (#EF4444), Level 3 - "Acil iÅŸlem gerekli"

### 6. **Routes & Security**

- âœ… **RESTful Routes** registered in `routes/web.php`
- âœ… **Policy-based authorization** - only authorized users can access
- âœ… **CSRF protection** on all forms
- âœ… **Input validation** and sanitization
- âœ… **Unlimited Level Support** - No maximum level limitation (previously limited to 1-10)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Priorities table
priorities: id, name, color, level, description, user_id, company_id, is_default, timestamps

-- Updated discoveries table
discoveries: ... priority_id (FK to priorities.id) ...
```

### Model Relationships

```php
// Priority Model
Priority belongsTo User
Priority belongsTo Company
Priority hasMany Discovery

// Discovery Model
Discovery belongsTo Priority (via priority_id)

// User Model (existing)
User hasMany Priority (for solo handymen)

// Company Model (existing)
Company hasMany Priority (for company priorities)
```

### Authorization Logic

- **Solo Handymen**: Can create/manage priorities with `user_id = auth()->id()`
- **Company Admins**: Can create/manage priorities with `company_id = auth()->user()->company_id`
- **Company Employees**: Cannot create/manage priorities (read-only access through discoveries)

### UI Features

- **Color Picker**: Interactive HTML5 color input with live preview
- **Badge Preview**: Real-time preview of how priority badge will look
- **Usage Statistics**: Shows count of discoveries using each priority
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Turkish Localization**: All interface text in Turkish

## Testing Results

### âœ… Successful Tests

2. **Migration Status**: All migrations ran successfully
3. **Model Relationships**: Priority-Discovery relationships working correctly
4. **User Interface**: All priority management pages load and function correctly
5. **Default Priority Creation**: Automatic priority creation for existing users working
