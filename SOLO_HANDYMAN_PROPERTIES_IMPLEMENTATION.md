# Solo Handyman Property Management - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### Task Completed

Enable solo handymen to have their own properties just like companies do. Solo handymen regularly visit the same properties for maintenance work and need the ability to manage saved property addresses for repeated use.

## üéØ FUNCTIONALITY ACHIEVED

### For Solo Handymen:

1. ‚úÖ **Full CRUD Access**: Can create, read, update, and delete their own properties
2. ‚úÖ **Property Management**: Access to Properties section in navigation
3. ‚úÖ **Discovery Integration**: Can select their saved properties when creating discoveries
4. ‚úÖ **Data Isolation**: Can only see and manage their own properties
5. ‚úÖ **User Interface**: Clear indication of property ownership

### For Companies:

1. ‚úÖ **Existing Functionality Preserved**: All company property management remains unchanged
2. ‚úÖ **Data Isolation**: Companies still only see their own properties
3. ‚úÖ **Authorization Maintained**: Existing permission structure intact

---

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Database Structure

```sql
-- Properties table now supports dual ownership
ALTER TABLE properties
ADD COLUMN user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
MODIFY company_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL;
```

### Ownership Logic

```php
// Property ownership is mutually exclusive
if ($user->isSoloHandyman()) {
    $property->user_id = $user->id;
    $property->company_id = null;
} else {
    $property->company_id = $user->company_id;
    $property->user_id = null;
}
```

### Data Scoping

```php
// Properties are scoped by user type
public function scopeAccessibleBy($query, User $user)
{
    if ($user->isSoloHandyman()) {
        return $query->where('user_id', $user->id);
    } elseif ($user->isCompanyAdmin() || $user->isCompanyEmployee()) {
        return $query->where('company_id', $user->company_id);
    }
    return $query->whereRaw('1 = 0');
}
```
