# Migration Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Cleaned up unnecessary migrations by consolidating incremental changes into the original table creation migrations.

## Removed Migrations (5 files)

### 1. Payment Method Related

- **`2025_06_08_094824_update_discoveries_table_for_payment_methods.php`** - Added `payment_method_id` column
- **`2025_06_17_192207_remove_payment_method_column_from_discoveries_table.php`** - Removed `payment_method` column
- **`2025_06_08_103340_remove_is_active_from_payment_methods_table.php`** - Removed `is_active` column from payment_methods

### 2. Address Enhancement Related

- **`2025_06_08_120146_add_coordinates_to_discoveries_table.php`** - Added latitude/longitude columns
- **`2025_06_17_064109_add_city_district_columns_to_discoveries_table.php`** - Added city/district columns

## Updated Migrations

### 1. `2025_02_13_000005_create_discoveries_table.php`

**Added directly to the initial table creation:**

- `city` (nullable string)
- `district` (nullable string)
- `latitude` (nullable decimal 10,8)
- `longitude` (nullable decimal 11,8)
- `payment_method_id` (nullable foreign key to payment_methods table)

**Removed:**

- `payment_method` (text field)

### 2. `2025_06_08_094801_create_payment_methods_table.php`

**Removed:**

- `is_active` boolean field
- Indexes that referenced `is_active`

**Updated indexes:**

- Simplified to `company_id` and `user_id` only

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Migration History**: Reduced from 18 to 13 migrations
2. **Faster Fresh Installs**: No incremental table modifications needed
3. **Better Maintainability**: Single source of truth for table structure
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated back-and-forth changes

## Database State

The final database structure remains exactly the same as before cleanup. This was a pure consolidation without any functional changes.

## Notes

- All removed migrations had already been executed
- The migration files were removed but the database schema is identical
- Future migrations should be planned more carefully to avoid similar incremental changes
