# Discovery Address Display and Editing Implementation

## Overview

Enhanced the discovery show/edit page to provide comprehensive address viewing and editing functionality for both manual and registered property addresses.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Address Display (View Mode)

- **Manual Addresses**: Shows the address text with identification as "Manuel Adres"
- **Property Addresses**: Shows property name and full formatted address with identification as "Kayıtlı Mülk"
- **Google Maps Integration**:
  - For addresses with coordinates: Direct link to exact location
  - For addresses without coordinates: Search link using address text

### 2. Address Editing (Edit Mode)

- **Current Address Display**: Shows existing address in a highlighted box
- **Change Address Button**: Opens a modal for address modification
- **Modal Features**:
  - Radio button selection between "Kayıtlı Mülk Seç" and "Manuel Adres Gir"
  - Property dropdown with property name and full address display
  - Manual address textarea with optional latitude/longitude inputs
  - Save/Cancel functionality

### 3. Backend Support

- **Controller Updates**: Enhanced `DiscoveryController@update` method to handle:
  - Property ID validation and access control
  - Address type switching logic
  - Coordinate management
- **Validation**: Added proper validation for property_id, latitude, and longitude fields

### 4. Shared Discovery Enhancement

- **Consistent Display**: Updated shared discovery template to use the same address display format
- **Google Maps Links**: Added same Google Maps functionality to shared views

## Files Modified

### Frontend Templates

1. **`resources/views/discovery/show.blade.php`**

   - Added Alpine.js-powered address display component
   - Implemented address change modal
   - Added Google Maps buttons with proper coordinate/search links
   - Enhanced with proper styling and user feedback

2. **`resources/views/discovery/shared.blade.php`**
   - Updated address display to match show page format
   - Added Google Maps integration
   - Improved visual presentation with property/manual address distinction

### Backend Controller

3. **`app/Http/Controllers/DiscoveryController.php`**
   - Enhanced `update` method validation to include property_id, latitude, longitude
   - Added address processing logic for property vs manual address handling
   - Implemented property access validation for security

### Test File

4. **`test-address-display.html`**
   - Created comprehensive test file demonstrating all address display scenarios
   - Shows manual addresses with/without coordinates
   - Shows property addresses
   - Demonstrates edit mode with modal functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### JavaScript Components

- **`addressDisplay()`**: Main component managing address state and modal visibility
- **`addressModalData()`**: Handles modal interactions, property loading, and address saving
- **API Integration**: Uses `/api/company-properties` endpoint for property loading

### CSS Enhancements

- Added `x-cloak` directive support to prevent content flashing
- Responsive design with proper mobile/desktop layouts
- Consistent color scheme with Tailwind CSS classes

### Data Flow

1. **View Mode**: Discovery model data → Template display → Google Maps links
2. **Edit Mode**: Current data → Modal form → Validation → Controller update → Database
3. **Property Selection**: API call → Property list → Selection → Coordinate extraction
4. **Manual Entry**: User input → Validation → Coordinate handling → Save

## Google Maps Integration

- **Coordinate-based**: Direct map view using lat/lng parameters
- **Address-based**: Search functionality using encoded address strings
- **Responsive buttons**: Clear visual indicators with map icons
- **New tab opening**: Links open in new tabs to preserve user workflow

## Security Considerations

- **Property Access Control**: Users can only select properties they have access to
- **Input Validation**: All coordinate and text inputs are properly validated
- **CSRF Protection**: Form submissions include CSRF tokens
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use proper parameter binding

## User Experience Enhancements

- **Visual Feedback**: Different colors and styles for property vs manual addresses
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear buttons and modal interactions
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works well on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where needed

## Testing

- Created comprehensive test file demonstrating all functionality
- Verified both authenticated and shared discovery views
- Tested address switching and Google Maps integration
- Confirmed proper data persistence and validation

This implementation provides a complete solution for address management in the discovery system, maintaining consistency across view and edit modes while providing excellent user experience.
