# Item Isolation Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented item isolation so that each solo handyman and company can only see and manage their own items, preventing data leakage between different users and organizations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Item Model (`app/Models/Item.php`)
✅ **Already properly configured with:**
- User/Company ownership fields (`user_id`, `company_id`)
- `accessibleBy($user)` scope for filtering items by ownership
- `isAccessibleBy($user)` method for permission checking
- Auto-ownership assignment in model boot method

### 2. ItemController (`app/Http/Controllers/ItemController.php`)
✅ **Fixed item scoping in:**
- `webSearch()` method - Now uses `accessibleBy($user)` scope
- `webSearchForDiscovery()` method - Now uses `accessibleBy($user)` scope
- All other methods already properly scoped

### 3. DiscoveryController (`app/Http/Controllers/DiscoveryController.php`)
✅ **Fixed item access validation in:**
- `store()` method - Now validates item ownership before attaching
- `update()` method - Now validates item ownership before attaching  
- `apiStore()` method - Now validates item ownership before attaching
- `apiUpdate()` method - Now validates item ownership before attaching

## Security Improvements

### Before
❌ Users could see and use items from other companies/handymen
❌ Search functions showed all items regardless of ownership
❌ Discovery creation could attach items not owned by the user

### After  
✅ Users can only see items they own or their company owns
✅ Search functions are properly scoped to user's accessible items
✅ Discovery creation validates item ownership before attaching
✅ Item management is completely isolated by ownership

## User Access Patterns

### Solo Handyman
- Can only see items where `user_id = their_id`
- Can only create items owned by themselves
- Cannot access items from other solo handymen or companies

### Company Admin/Employee
- Can only see items where `company_id = their_company_id`
- Can only create items owned by their company
- Cannot access items from other companies or solo handymen

## Technical Implementation

### Scoping Method
```php
public function scopeAccessibleBy(Builder $query, User $user): Builder
{
    if ($user->isSoloHandyman()) {
        return $query->where('user_id', $user->id);
    } elseif ($user->isCompanyAdmin() || $user->isCompanyEmployee()) {
        return $query->where('company_id', $user->company_id);
    }
    return $query->whereRaw('1 = 0'); // No items for invalid user types
}
```

### Usage Pattern
```php
// Before (insecure)
$items = Item::where('item', 'like', "%{$query}%")->get();

// After (secure)
$items = Item::accessibleBy($user)->where('item', 'like', "%{$query}%")->get();
```

## Testing Verification

To verify the implementation works:

1. **Create items as different users** - Solo handyman and company users
2. **Search for items** - Each user should only see their own items
3. **Try to attach items to discoveries** - Should only allow owned items
4. **Test API endpoints** - Should respect ownership boundaries

## Data Integrity

- Existing items maintain their current ownership
- New items automatically get correct ownership via model boot method
- No data migration required as user/company ownership was already established

## Complete ✅

The item isolation feature is now fully implemented and secure. Users can only see, search, and use items that belong to them or their organization.
